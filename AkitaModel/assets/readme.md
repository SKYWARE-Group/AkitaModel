# Akita Data Model

This package is a data model (DTO) of Akita (LIS iLab API). It does not contain any HTTP
client implementation. You may use implementation of your choice, such as 
[Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit).

Use `AkitaJsonOptions.JsonSerializerOptions` to serialize and deserialize model objects.

Please, read [the documentation](https://akita-docs.skyware-group.com/) for further
